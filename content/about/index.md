## About Me

Hi, I'm Yu-Jie (Marcos).

I currently focus on SRE and DevOps, with a particular interest in how systems maintain reliability targets under high traffic and real-time demands, and whether they have good observability to quickly identify and recover from inevitable failures.

I've been deeply involved in distributed systems and cloud architecture, often making trade-offs between reliability, performance, cost, and delivery speed. Rather than pursuing idealized designs, I care more about: whether risks are clearly understood, whether failures are predictable, and whether systems have sufficient resilience.

This blog records these reflections, and it's not just about technology. You'll find:

**TECH**: Practical experiences and design trade-offs in SRE / DevOps, cloud, and distributed systems

**LIFE**: Daily observations and thoughts from an engineer's perspective

**INVESTMENT**: Personal understanding of investment and risk

**BOOK'S REVIEWS**: Books I've read, both technical and non-technical

**ARCHIVE / ALL POSTS**: Simply for reviewing what I've written

**ABOUT**: If you want to know what this person is thinking about

Beyond engineering, I love all kinds of small animals—I'm definitely a dog person, but I also have a soft spot for rabbits and various reptiles. As for Western and Latin culture, it's a long-standing interest I don't plan to give up, whether it's language, music, or books. I hope you can find something here that resonates with you.

If you're interested in Site Reliability Engineering / DevOps / Platform Engineering, or just want to see how an engineer switches perspectives between technology and life, there should be some content here that you'll understand and perhaps nod along with.
